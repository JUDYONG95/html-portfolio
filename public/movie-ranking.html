<h1>Judy's Top Movie Recommendations</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2><hr />

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Despite being a relatively old film, the context and main messaging of the film remain relevant. It is a hopeful film and I highly recommend this.</p>

<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>Another film with a meaningful message to stay hopeful and challenge the societal norms of pursuing academic success.</p>

<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</h3>
<p>One of the latest films I watched this year, yet it remains memorable because of the friendship it portrays. Plus points for managing to incorporate both comedic and touching elements in the show.</p>
